Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 

  ! usually is used:
  - either in a method name to indicate that the method mutates the caller (a naming convention)
  - or to signify "not" in logic.

  ? is usually used:
  - in a method name to indicate that the method performs some check and returns a Boolean value (a naming convention)
  - or is used as the ternary operator for if/else statements

And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?
  - It means 'not equal to' and it should be used in conditionals

put ! before something, like !user_name
  - It would turn user_name into the opposite of their Boolean equivalent

put ! after something, like words.uniq!
  - Just adding a '!' doesn't make a method mutable. However, if as per the documentation a mutable version 
  - of that method exists, as it does with uniq, than that means the method doesn't return an amended copy, 
  - but mutates the caller

put ? before something
  - A ? before a character denotes a single character string

put ? after something
  - After a method name, this usually signifies that the method returns a Boolean value
  - Can also be the start of the ternary if else expression

put !! before something, like !!user_name
  - turns an object into their Boolean equivalent
