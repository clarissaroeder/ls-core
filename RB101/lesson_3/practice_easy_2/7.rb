# In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:
# flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
# flintstones << "Dino"

# We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.
# How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
p flintstones.push("Dino", "Hoppy")

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
p flintstones.concat(["Dino", "Hoppy"])
