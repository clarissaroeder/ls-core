# Let's call a method, pass two strings as arguments and see how they can be treated differently depending on the method invoked on them inside the method definition.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(string_param_one, string_param_two)
  string_param_one += "rutabaga"
  string_param_two << "rutabaga"
end

string_arg_one = "pumpkins"
string_arg_two = "pumpkins"
tricky_method(string_arg_one, string_arg_two)

puts "String_arg_one looks like this now: #{string_arg_one}"
puts "String_arg_two looks like this now: #{string_arg_two}"

# Prediction: reassignment with concatenation is not destructive. << is destructive. String_arg_one will not be mutated, whereas string_arg_two will be.
