1. A method that returns the sum of two integers

    Define a method called "add" that takes to integers as input.
      - Add the two integers together and save result in a variable.
      - Return that variable.


    START

    SET method "add"(integer 1, integer 2)
      SET result = integer 1 + integer 2
    END

2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

    Define a method called "make sentence" that takes an array of strings as input
      - Iterate through the array:
        - For each iteration, add the current element to a variable "sentence". 
        - Add a space after each word except the last. (Or check if there is a method to append with space automatically)
      
      - Return sentence
    

    START

    SET method "make_sentence"(strings[])
      SET sentence = nil;
      WHILE iterator < length of strings[]
        add strings[iterator] to sentence
        add space (if necessary)

      REMOVE trailing space
      RETURN sentence
    END

3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.

    Define a method called "every_other" that takes an array of integers as input
      - Iterate through the array:
        - If the index is even, append that number to a new array
    
      - Return the new array

    
    START

    SET method "every_other"(integers[])
      SET new_array = []
      WHILE iterator < length of integers[]
        IF iterator.even?
          append integers[iterator] to new_array
        
      RETURN new_array
    END

4. A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', 
   the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.
   
    Define a method called "third" that takes a string and a character as input
      - Set a counter to 0
      - Iterate over the string:
        - If the current character is equal to the input character:
          - Add one to the counter
          - If counter is equal to 3:
            - Return iterator
      
      - If counter is smaller than 3:
        - Return nil
      
    
    START

    SET method "third"(string, character)
      SET counter = 0
      WHILE iterator < string length
        IF string[iterator] == character
          counter += 1

          IF counter == 3
            return iterator
      
      IF counter < 3
        return nil
    END

4. A method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements 
   at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes

    Define a method called "merge" that takes two arrays as input:
      - Define new array
      - Iterate over the arrays:
        - Add element at iterator-th position of array 1 to the same position in the new array
        - Add element at iterator-th position of array 2 to iterator-th + 1 position in the new array
      - Return new array
    

    START
  
    SET method "merge"(array1, array2)
      SET new_array = []
      WHILE iterator < length of array1
        new_array[iterator] = array1[iterator]
        new_array[iterator + 1] = array2[iterator]
      
      return new_array
    END
