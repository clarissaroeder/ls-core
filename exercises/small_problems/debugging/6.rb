=begin
We wrote a method for moving a given number of elements from one array to another. 
We decide to test it on our todo list, but invoking move on line 11 results in a SystemStackError. 
What does this error mean and why does it happen?
=end

def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  # missing base case
  return if n == 0 || from_array.empty?
  to_array << from_array.shift
  move(n - 1, from_array, to_array)
end

# Example

todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

move(4, todo, done)

p todo # should be: ['coffee with Tom']
p done # should be: ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']
