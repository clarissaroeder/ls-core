What are the differences between Ruby's `File::path` and `File#path` methods?

1. Usage
   - `File::path` is a class method, called on the File class.
   - `File#path` is an instance method, called on an object of class File.
  
2. Purpose
   - `File::path` is used to convert a Pathname object or a string representative of a path into a string representation.
   - `File#path` is used to retrieve a string representation of the path to the file object (where it was first created)

3. Input parameter
   - `File::path` takes a string or a Pathname object as arguments
   - `File#path` doesn't take any arguments
