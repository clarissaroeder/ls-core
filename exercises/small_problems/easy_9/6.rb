=begin

Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a count, and the second is the 
first number of a sequence that your method will create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number 
of elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be multiples of the starting number.

You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or greater, 
while the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is 0, an empty list should be returned.

ALGORITHM:
- Create result array
- Iterate count number of times: 
  - Append start times current iteration to array
- Return result array

=end

def sequence(count, start)
  result = []
  1.upto(count) { |i| result << start * i }
  result
end

# Examples:
p sequence(5, 1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
p sequence(4, -7) == [-7, -14, -21, -28]
p sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0]
p sequence(0, 1000000) == []
