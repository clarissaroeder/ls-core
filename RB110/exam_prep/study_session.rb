# A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.
  
# A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.
  
# Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.

p count_vowel_substrings("abcde") == 0
p count_vowel_substrings("cuaieuouac") == 7
p count_vowel_substrings("aeiouu") == 2

# You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in expanded form. For example:
#
# expanded_form(12); # Should return '10 + 2'
# expanded_form(42); # Should return '40 + 2'
# expanded_form(70304); # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
#
# Note: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.

p expanded_form(12) == '10 + 2'
p expanded_form(42) == '40 + 2'
p expanded_form(70304) == '70000 + 300 + 4'
